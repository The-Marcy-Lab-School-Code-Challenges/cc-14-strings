# Code Challenge: Control Flow

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to your `code-challenges' directory in AWS Cloud9.  
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems

1. Declare a function named `averageInArray` that will calculate the  average of the elements in an array of numbers. You must solve this without using any array methods.  
```
averageInArray([2,4,5,7,8]) // returns 19.8
averageInArray([2,2,5,10]) // returns 4.75
averageInArray([2,2,2,2,2]) //returns 2
```
