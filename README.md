# Code Challenge: Control Flow

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to your `code-challenges' directory in AWS Cloud9.  
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems

1. Declare a function named `removeSpaces` that takes in a string argument and returns a new string with all the white spaces removed. You must solve this without using any JavaScript string methods.
```
removeSpaces("Hello I love to code.") // "HelloIlovetocode."
removeSpaces("Marcy Lab  School") // "MarcyLabSchool"
```
